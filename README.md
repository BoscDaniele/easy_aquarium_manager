# easy_aquarium_manager

A new Flutter project for one of my hobbies which is Aquascaping(Making beautiful aquariums).

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for an easy Aquarium manager that helps me and maybe others to easily manage and improve their own aquariums.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
